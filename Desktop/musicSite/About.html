<h3>Critical Reflection:</h3>
This website was my second attempt at producing web content using HTML5 and CSS3.<br><br>

Once I decided which music genre, I set about planning the website. I broke the process down into ordered stages these were: 1) a paper prototype design 2) site map 3) Sourcing Content 4)Structure/mark up 5)Presentation/CSS.<br><br>
Paper prototype design was a simple pen and paper process. I planned  where the layout of menus, content and navigation panels would sit on the site. I planned to keep this constant across the site to minimize work and keep continuity.<br><br>
I planned the site map next. This was simply a case of order of specific pages and what they would be linked to. Also, I arranged the files and folders on the computer so the html and css files were readily found and organised. <br><br>
Sourcing content was collecting information, styling and images which I was going to use for content. I had some problems here with choosing appropriate images with regard  to pixel sizes. By the time I had arrived at the presentation stage, many of the images I had decided to use were not suitable for the styling I wanted as the pixel size was too small to be enlarged and the quality of the image was not good enough.<br><br>
Next I set about building the main structure of the site using HTML5 and Notepad++. I wanted to keep it simple, functionable and familiar to users. I decided to break the site down into 4 main "div" and assign them a class. These were  "header", "nav","content" and "footer". I also decided to go with a fixed backound image which I probably wouldn't do again as the image caused complications with positioning of "div".  I also linked my style sheet, put in my validators and linked my navigation/menu buttons to their relevant pages.<br><br>
Finally, Presentation using CSS3. The fun bit and the stage I spent the most time in and had the most issues. The main problem I had was positioning and margins when the browser was resized. I used the "inspect" function a lot and found it really useful. I also styled my links to change colour when used etc. I put my styled content text into the center of the page and inserted relevant images into the text keeping them deliberately small and close to the text which was broken down into small, bitesize pieces of information for quick reading.<br><br>
With the benefit of hindsight, there is not a lot I would change about the process I used to carry out the task. I still think I need to learn more about CSS and styling but then I'm not really one for design. I enjoyed the mark up stage the most and I also enjoyed using new elements to create login and registration forms. It will be nice to realise the whole site using server side scripting and link a database to record client side information. With some practise/experience, I'm confident I could produce better web content in future.
